Willow Core Scaffold — Proprietary

This module implements Willow's 5-phase adaptive cycle:
    1. Anchor   — Establishes temporal and contextual ground truth
    2. Analyze  — Evaluates incoming messages for drift signals
    3. Ground   — Reinforces behavioral constraints
    4. Reflect  — Detects goal abandonment and constraint violations
    5. Stabilize — Auto-repairs responses before they reach your users

The scaffold is applied turn-by-turn at inference time, compounding
stability over long conversations without retraining or rebuilding
existing infrastructure.

Core architecture is proprietary and protected under provisional patents.
