Willow Constraint Engine — Proprietary

This module implements Willow's behavioral constraint enforcement,
including:

    - Pre-response constraint validation
    - Instruction hierarchy preservation
    - Behavioral boundary enforcement
    - Response steering before output reaches end users
    - Adaptive constraint application based on drift signals

Part of Willow's Adaptive Drift Correction system — constraints are
enforced turn-by-turn without retraining or modifying the underlying
model.

Core architecture is proprietary and protected under provisional patents.
