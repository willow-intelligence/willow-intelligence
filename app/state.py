Willow Session State Manager — Proprietary

This module implements Willow's session framing and temporal anchoring
system, including:

    - Per-session behavioral state tracking
    - Temporal anchor establishment and verification
    - Cross-turn context continuity enforcement
    - Session framing initialization and teardown
    - Real-time grounding signal injection

State is maintained across conversation turns to ensure compounding
stability — the longer the conversation, the more stable the model.

Core architecture is proprietary and protected under provisional patents.
