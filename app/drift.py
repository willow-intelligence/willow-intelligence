Willow Drift Detection Engine — Proprietary

This module implements Willow's real-time behavioral drift detection,
including:

    - Long-context drift scoring across conversation turns
    - Instruction hierarchy enforcement and violation detection
    - Goal abandonment signal identification
    - Constraint compliance monitoring
    - Adaptive drift correction triggers

Drift scores are exposed as measurable infrastructure metrics
(drift_rate, repair_count, stability_index) via the Willow API.
